# Vacination Analysis

Project for CPSC 375 at CSUF

This R program intakes and tidies vaccine, hospital bed, and demographic data from excel spreadsheets and creates a table of vaccination rates per country. 

The program then creates a scatterplot of only the most recent vaccination rate for every country and the number of days since first vaccination.

A bar plot is also included that compares the R-squared values of 5 linear models based on the data.
