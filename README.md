# Vacination Analysis

This R program intakes and tidies vaccine, hospital bed, and demographic data from excel spreadsheets and creates a table of vaccination rates per country. 

The program then creates a scatterplot of only the most recent vaccination rate for every country and the number of days since first vaccination and creates 5 linear models whose R2 values are compared using a bar plot.
